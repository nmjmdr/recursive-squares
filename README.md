# A simple program that generates recursive squares

## Pattern
Initially a square is drawn with a specified width. Let us call this "square-0"
On every corner of this square-0, four more squares with width equal to half of the the with of square-0 are generated.

The above steps are then recursively applied to each of the generated squares.

The following pattern is generated:

## Examples of patterns generated by tweaking start step, width, multiplier:

### changing the way corners are obtained, like below:
```
function getCorners(x,y,w) {
  var corners = [];
  corners.push({x:x-w/1-w/1.5,y:y-w/1-w/1.5})
  corners.push({x:x+w/1+w/1.5,y:y-w/1-w/1.5})
  corners.push({x:x+w/1+w/1.5,y:y+w/1+w/1.5})
  corners.push({x:x-w/1-w/1.5,y:y+w/1+w/1.5})
  return corners
}
```
Produces this:
