# A simple program that generates recursive squares

## Pattern
Initially a square is drawn with a specified width. Let us call this "square-0"
On every corner of this square-0, four more squares with width equal to half of the the with of square-0 are generated.

The above steps are then recursively applied to each of the generated squares.

The pattern is generated is:
